The dashboard presents Overall Rating, NPS, Feedback Category Scores, Purpose of Visit, Gender distribution, Booking Source distribution, and Trend Analysis.

* Feedback Ratings for:
  Staff attitude
  Check-in process
  Room service
  Room cleanliness
  Food quality
  Variety of food

* Overall Experience Rating (1 to 5)

This survey structure was used to generate a realistic dataset of 1000 responses.
